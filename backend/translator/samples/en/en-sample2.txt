30-year-old male patient who referred to our clinic with the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient had a history of stage IV-B non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in 2005 and treated with radiochemotherapy, currently in remission. Our patient presented with polydipsia and polyuria without associated bone pain. The laboratory tests showed a serum calcium of 12.7 mg/dl and preserved renal function. Cervical ultrasound performed preoperatively showed a hyperechogenic nodule of 9 mm adjacent to the left lower thyroid pole. A scintigraphy was performed in which a pathological hypercaptation was observed at the level of the left inferior thyroid.
